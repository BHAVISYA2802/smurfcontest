    <h2 class="section-title">Event Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>üé® Smurf Face Painting Contest:- A Smurf face painting contest would likely involve participants of all ages decorating their faces to resemble Smurfs, likely with blue and white paint, and potentially incorporating other Smurf-related elements. The event might be part of a larger celebration, such as World Smurf Day, and could include other activities like drawing, coloring, and even a movie screening. </li>
      <br>
      <li>üï∫ Smurf Dance Battle:-  Smurfs Dance Party is a dance rhythm game developed by Japanese studio Land Ho! and published by Ubisoft for the Wii as a spin-off title to the Just Dance Kids series. The game was released on July 19, 2011, in North America,[2] July 29, 2011 in Europe and September 8, 2011, in Australia.</li>
      <br>
      <li>üì∏ Best Smurf Costume Awards:- The "Best Smurf Costume Award," also known as "The Golden Smurf Award," is a fictional award featured in the Smurfs universe. It's an idea proposed by Brainy Smurf to honor the Smurf with the "smurfiest contribution to the world of Smurf". The award ceremony involves Smurfs presenting their contributions, with the intention that Brainy would win. In the episode, Smurfette, Brainy, Handy, Vanity, Painter, Harmony, Greedy, Jokey, Tailor, and Farmer participate by creating their own gimmicked-up contributions. </li>
      <br>
      <li>üèÜ Smurf Olympics (Mini Games):- The Smurf Olympics, also known as the Smurfic Games, is a recurring event in the Smurfs universe where the Smurfs participate in various athletic competitions, often inspired by the Olympic Games. These games are a way for the Smurfs to stay active, sharpen their skills, and engage in friendly competition. One notable example is the "Smurfic Games" where Brainy Smurf learns to appreciate Clumsy after losing his glasses and needing help. Another instance involves Grouchy Smurf's fear of water, which leads to a dangerous situation when Gargamel interferes. </li>
      <br>
      <li>üé§ Live Smurf Musical Night:- The Smurfs Live on Stage" is a musical theatre production featuring live actors in Smurf costumes singing and dancing. The show, which includes a story about the Smurfs saving Mother Nature from Gargamel, is a two-act extravaganza lasting 70 minutes. It incorporates life-size Smurf mushroom houses, vibrant backdrops, and sing-along music. The production has been touring since 2014. </li>
